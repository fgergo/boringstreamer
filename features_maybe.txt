req: no more command line flags or arguments when implementing a new feature

- possibly avoid playing always the same first file, if other files can be found in 1 second of starting bs
- more file formats (ogg?)
- simplify code if possible
- stream audio from standard input, possibly needs a new flag, reconsider if it's worth it
