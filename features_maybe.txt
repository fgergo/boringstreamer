requirement for new features: when implementing a new feature, the # of flags or # of arguments should not grow 

- more file formats, AAC, AC3, enhanced AC3)
- profile again
- ReadAll() problem with streaming from standard input -> 1. stripID3header() shall work without ReadAll(), i.e. need to parse ID3 header...

NEW APP
- stream files based on some heuristical url matching, using url path as a cue not as a pointer. E.g http://ipaddress:4444/liszt should play from directory "Ferenc Liszt/" or play file non-case sensitive match of "*liszt*.mp3"

DONE
- possibly avoid playing always the same first file, if other files can be found in 0.1 second of starting bs
- added hidden -debug flag for more terse verbose mode, reserve log format for debug information
- stream audio from standard input
- change default path to "/" + "/" works on windows too
