req: no more command line flags or arguments when implementing a new feature

- stream files based on some heuristical url matching, using url path as a cue not as a pointer. E.g http://ipaddress:4444/liszt should play from directory "Ferenc Liszt/" or play file non-case sensitive match of "*liszt*.mp3"

- more file formats (ogg?)
- simplify code if possible
- stream audio from standard input, possibly needs a new flag, reconsider if it's worth it

DONE
- possibly avoid playing always the same first file, if other files can be found in 0.1 second of starting bs
